  ---------------------------------
    - This is where you validate the input
    - Ensure all required fields are provided, check uniqueness, check format of input (numbers are really numbers and not letters), etc.
    - This always returns a hash with two keys - valid being either true or false, and if false - errors with details why validation has failed.
