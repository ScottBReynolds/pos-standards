# Unofficial Standards for PlatformOS

## Purpose:
The intention is to create a more uniform way to structure and "code" a PlatformOS project. When a PlatformOS project adheres to community standards readability, maintainability, and reusability are improved.

### Benefits of standards:

- Speeds up development
- Lowers development costs
- Avoids duplicated efforts ("reinventing the wheel")
- Aligns the community (reduce fragmentation/silos)
- Increases community support
- Encourages building and sharing compatible components
- Makes it easier to hire freelance pOS developers
- Speeds up onboarding/training

## How to use this guide:
This guide is divided between examples and specific recommendations.
You will find examples in the modules folder. Each module can be used as a reference to see the standards in action, or used as a starting point for your own module.
The standards are broken up in to three categories (structure, naming, and coding).
